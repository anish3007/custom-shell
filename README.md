# custom-shell
###Building a custom shell - 
We use linux shell where we give commands such as ls, cat, grep, etc and the shell executes the command. In this project I am trying to implement a custom designed shell that will take a custom command from the user, execute the command and show the output.
This is inspired from an interesting [blog](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) by Stephen Brennan.

###Compile
  gcc -o csh csh.c
  
###Execute
  ./csh
